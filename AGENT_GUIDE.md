# AGENT GUIDE: The Basalt Concept

## **1. Product Vision**
**Basalt** is a macOS application designed to bring **Fine Art** into the daily digital workspace.

*   **Core Promise**: "Human" curation over AI. We celebrate the masters of art history—Matisse, Van Gogh, Hokusai.
*   **The Problem**: Screensavers and wallpapers have become generic, algorithmic, or distracting.
*   **The Solution**: A daily, curated piece of fine art that transforms the desktop into a gallery wall. It is quiet, educational, and aesthetically profound.

## **2. Design Philosophy**
The design of this website mirrors the app: **Minimalist, Premium, and Organic.**

### **Aesthetics**
*   **The "White Card"**: The interface feels like a high-end museum placard. It supports the art, never competing with it.
*   **Whitespace**: We use generous padding. Content breathes. Nothing is cramped.
*   **Organic Palette**: We strictly use the **OKLCH Stone Palette** (`--stone-50` to `--stone-950`). Note the lack of sterile "pure blacks" or "digital blues". Everything has a touch of warmth and earthiness.

### **Typography**
*   **Headings (`Source Serif 4`)**: evoke the authority and elegance of art history books.
*   **UI & Body (`Inter`)**: provide modern utility and readability without friction.
*   **Fluidity**: Typography scales organically with the viewport (`clamp()`), ensuring a balanced reading experience on any device.

## **3. The Website's Role**
This website is not a "SaaS Marketing Site" full of flashy gradients and aggressive CTAs.
It is a **Digital Gallery**.

*   **Purpose**: To showcase the "Art of the Day" and provide a simple path to download the Mac app.
*   **Vibe**: Calm, sophisticated, confident.
*   **Layouts**: We favor **Standard Grids** (`r-grid`) and **Canvas Wrappers** that frame content like a painting on a wall.

## **4. Interaction Guidelines**
*   **Buttons**: Simple outlines or subdued fills. Hover effects are subtle or playful (like our random color fill), but never jarring.
*   **Animations**: If used, they must be slow (`ease-out`), mimicking the physical weight of premium interactions.

*If you are editing this site, ask yourself: "Does this feel like a museum or a startup?" If it feels like a startup, simplify it.*
